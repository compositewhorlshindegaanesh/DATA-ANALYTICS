Difference between a function and a method in Python\n","- **Function** is a block of reusable code defined using `def`, that operates independently.  \n","- **Method** is a function associated with an object.  \n","\n","```python\n","def greet():  # function\n","    return \"Hello\"\n","\n","s = \"Python\"\n","s.upper()  # upper() is a method\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. Function arguments vs. parameters in Python\n","- **Parameters** are variable names in the function definition.  \n","- **Arguments** are actual values passed to the function when calling it.  \n","\n","```python\n","def add(x, y):  # x, y = parameters\n","    return x + y\n","\n","add(3, 4)  # 3, 4 = arguments\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. Ways to define and call a function in Python\n","\n","```python\n","def square(n):\n","    return n * n\n","\n","print(square(5))\n","\n","# Lambda\n","square = lambda n: n * n\n","print(square(5))\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4.

Iterators vs. Iterables\n","\n","```python\n","nums = [1, 2, 3]  # iterable\n","it = iter(nums)   # iterator\n","print(next(it))   # prints 1\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 6.
